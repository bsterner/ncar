A stack is a collection of services that make up an application in a specific environment. A stack file is a file in YAML format, similar to a docker-compose.yml file, that defines one or more services. The YAML reference is documented here.

Stacks are a convenient way to automatically deploy multiple services that are linked to each other, without needing to define each one separately.

Stack files define environment variables, deployment tags, the number of containers, and related environment-specific configuration. Because of this, you should use a separate stack file for development, staging, production, and other environments.
